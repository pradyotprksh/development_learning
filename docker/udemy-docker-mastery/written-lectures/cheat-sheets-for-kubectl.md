# Cheat Sheets for Kubectl

The kubectl CLI for Kubernetes can be more complex than Docker tools, so people have created cheat sheets.

**Here are a few from the official Kubernetes docs:**

[kubectl Cheat Sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/)

[kubectl for Docker Users](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/docker-cli-to-kubectl/)

**And this is an [entire website](https://cheatography.com/) full of cheat sheets, and you can make your own.**

And, of course, remember the inline help with `--help`.  Even just typing `kubectl` and hitting enter will show you short descriptions of all the major commands.
