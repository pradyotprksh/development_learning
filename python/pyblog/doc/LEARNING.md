## Project Structure
Before I start working on any project, the first thing I do is to look what is the easiest and comfortable way to 
structure your project.

It's a crucial topic in any project. How to structure the project. Because in the long run if the structure is not good 
then it will create a lot of issues related to understanding and testing.

After some searching and banging my head on the laptop I found https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/.

It gives the details on how you should be structuring the project, but it will vary on the type of project you are 
working on.

## Ignore Files

Since, I am going to push the code to GitHub it's better to ignore those files which are not needed and need to be 
protected for security reasons.

I am not sure which files to ignore in Python, so I found a repository which provides the .gitignore for different 
languages. You can find the details here https://github.com/github/gitignore.
