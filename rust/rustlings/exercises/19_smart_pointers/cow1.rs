// cow1.rs
//
// This exercise explores the Cow, or Clone-On-Write type. Cow is a
// clone-on-write smart pointer. It can enclose and provide immutable access to
// borrowed data, and clone the data lazily when mutation or ownership is
// required. The type is designed to work with general borrowed data via the
// Borrow trait.
//
// This exercise is meant to show you what to expect when passing data to Cow.
// Fix the unit tests by checking for Cow::Owned(_) and Cow::Borrowed(_) at the
// TODO markers.
//
// Execute `rustlings hint cow1` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a hint.

// I AM NOT DONE
