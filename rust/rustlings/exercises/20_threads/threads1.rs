// threads1.rs
//
// This program spawns multiple threads that each run for at least 250ms, and
// each thread returns how much time they took to complete. The program should
// wait until all the spawned threads have finished and should collect their
// return values into a vector.
//
// Execute `rustlings hint threads1` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a
// hint.
